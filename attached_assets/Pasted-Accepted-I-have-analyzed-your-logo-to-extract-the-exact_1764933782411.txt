Accepted. I have analyzed your logo to extract the exact color psychology needed for a premium, non-template look.

The Color Palette Strategy (Based on Logo):

Deep Royal Purple (Primary): From the "Padmarajam" text. Represents Wisdom, Royalty, and Ambition. Use this for Headers and Footer.

Persimmon Orange (Accent/CTA): From the shield's top-left. Represents Energy and Action. Use this only for Buttons ("Call Now", "Enroll").

Slate Blue (Secondary): From the shield's bottom. Represents Trust and Intelligence. Use this for background accents or icons.

Silver/Grey (Neutral): From the shield. Use for borders and card backgrounds.

Here is the Master Prompt. You can give this to a developer, a UI designer, or an advanced AI site builder (like Framer AI, Elementor AI, or v0.dev).

The Master Prompt: "The Authority" Landing Page
Role: You are a Senior UI/UX Designer and Conversion Copywriter specializing in High-End Educational Institutions. Project: Design the Homepage for "Padmarajam Institute of Management (PRIM)." Brand Identity: Established 1995. Premium. Serious. Academic. Visual Style: Modern Professional (NOT generic corporate bootstrap). Clean typography, Bento-grid layouts, and high-contrast calls to action.

1. Visual & Color Guidelines (Strict Adherence)
Primary Background: Clean White (#FFFFFF) or very soft Off-White (#F8F9FA) to allow the content to breathe.

Typography:

Headings: 'Playfair Display' or 'Merriweather' (Serif) – to signal History and Prestige (Est. 1995).

Body: 'Inter' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (Sans-Serif) – for high readability and modern feel.

Color Palette (Derived from Logo):

Dominant Brand Color: Deep Royal Purple (Hex: #4A154B) – Use for the Navbar, Footer, and Main Headings.

Action Color (Buttons): Vibrant Persimmon Orange (Hex: #F26522) – Use for "Book Counselling" and "Call Now" buttons. High visibility.

Trust Color: Deep Slate Blue (Hex: #005696) – Use for icon backgrounds and "Trust Badges" (ISO Certified).

2. UI Layout & Copy Structure
A. Sticky Navbar (Glassmorphism Effect)

Trust Ticker (Below Hero): "ISO Certified | Recognized by TNOU | 3 Decades of Excellence."

C. The "Core 4" Course Grid (Bento Box Style)
